# Deep_Agents

**Explore and develop deep agents with LangGraph**
_Last updated: October 2025_

## About This Repository

This repo is dedicated to hands-on experimentation with the [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) agent framework during October–November 2025.
Projects are split into folders, each representing an independent agent implementation, demo, or prototype.

- All code is posted in its current state—raw, refactored, or exploratory.
- The focus is accelerated agent development, tool integration, and solutioning, rather than polished deliverables.

> **Background**:
> Building on my experience as a production data scientist, ML engineer, and agent system experimenter ([see main profile](https://github.com/cjrockball)), I'm using this space for rapid prototyping and conceptual deep dives.
> My wider machine learning journey and skill development are documented in [learning_journey](https://github.com/CJRockball/learning_journey), which shows my evolution from research scientist to full-stack ML system builder.

***

## Current Folder Structure

- `Agent/` — Specialized agent prototypes (e.g. stateful agents, tool-using approaches)
- `Basic_deepagent/` — Minimal example agents to illustrate LangGraph concepts
- `deep_academic_agent/` — Agents with academic/learning-focused features

_Folders will expand as additional agent demos and experiments are added. Each represents a standalone investigation into agentic workflows, checkpointing, tool use, or persistent state logic according to the LangGraph paradigm._

***

## Repository Philosophy

- **Growth mindset**: Expect incomplete or unrefined code as a record of practical skill progression and iterative experimentation.
- **Transparency**: Projects are as-is, with evolutionary improvements over time.
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and markdown notes provided where possible; major learnings and design decisions will be chronicled in folder-specific `README`s.

***

## Intended Audience

- ML engineers, agent system developers, and LangGraph enthusiasts seeking code examples, patterns, or inspiration.
- Anyone interested in the application and evolution of agentic AI architectures in Python.
